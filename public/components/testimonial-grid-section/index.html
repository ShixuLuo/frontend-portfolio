            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, 
            in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

            "I was an emt for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a 
            transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
            for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
            the next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. since completing 
            the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a software engineer at a VR startup."

            awesome teaching support from tas who did the bootcamp themselves. getting guidance from them and 
            learning from their experiences was easy.

            such a life-changing experience. highly recommended!

            “ before joining the bootcamp, i’ve never written a line of code. i needed some structure from 
            professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. i was encouraged to enroll by a former 
            student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. the entire curriculum and staff 
            did not disappoint. they were very hands-on and i never had to wait long for assistance. the agile team 
            project, in particular, was outstanding. it took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
            could ever have. in fact, i’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
            experience. it certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
            100% recommend! ”
